Problems:
    Duplicate attributes, I assume they were introduced after the text normalisation

Feature selection:
    Create feature vectors with respect to the users NOT the tweets

    Eliminiate stop words

    Use Jaccard Coefficent instead of Stemming?
    
    Only consider words which appear more frequently??
    
    Identify words which carry local relevance

Weka:
    Any algorithm can NOT guess any attribute
